This is a simple application which shows how to use the new annotations (@Controller, @RequestMapping etc)
in Spring 3 MVC and hibernate validator for validation. I also showed how you can configure the web.xml 

Please look at the pom file for the libraries that are used and the version information.

I ran the application with Tomcat 6 and jetty. 

Run the tomcat or jetty and browse to:
http://localhost:8080/Spring3MVCAndHibernateValidatorDemo/index.jsp
